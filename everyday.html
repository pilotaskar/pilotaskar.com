        Hi, I'm here today again. Today I'm not working, so will be ciding till evening. This is great. First thing first lets look our Doordash website design. I'll fix it a little bit and will post to project part if I finish. Yes, worked a little bit on Doordash page. But there is no learning things for now. Now will look class lesssons. <br>
        Now let's create our plan. First I have to learn my All Javascript short videos.<br>
        <i class="fas fa-hourglass-start"></i></i> All JavaScript short videos</p>
        And also I have to focus only my main plan. No, LinkeDin forexample. It takes my valuable time. Today experienced this also.

        Hi, today I learned center tag. It makes our text automatically center. And in style part if you make margin right, and margin left auto and width some pixel it makes our text middle with that width.</p>
