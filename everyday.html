        Hi, today lets look a bit Fundamental JavaScript part again.
        Yestarday I learned about Variables- global scope, Function scope , and block scope. SO let's I'll try to remember them. I'll give three examplel in comment. <br><br>

        Now let's consentrate to hoisting. I'm not sure about this topic. <br>
        Today I started to work with Kutman. It's iinteresting. i mean pair working i sinteresting. I forgot this method. I used this method with Jolbors bayke. For this interesting method you need one person same level with you and same interest to smth learning or working. <br>
        Today with Kutman we are learned some HTML elements. Now trying to learn 'area' element. I think it's very interesting. 
        </p>

        <!-- Global scope 
        let a=5; is global scope 

        Function scope 
        function askar(){
            var = a; if we use inside a block var it will be function scope
        }

        Block scope 
        function askar() {
           let a=5;
           const b=6;
        }

        if we are using inside a block let or const it will be block scope -->
